/**
 * This script tests an upgraded EOA by verifying ownership and executing an ETH transfer
 *
 * Prerequisites:
 * 1. EOA must already be upgraded using UpgradeEOA.s.sol
 * 2. For local testing: Anvil node must be running with --odyssey flag
 * 3. For Odyssey testnet: Must have environment variables set:
 *    - EOA_PRIVATE_KEY: Private key of the EOA being upgraded
 *    - NEW_OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY: Private key of the account that will be the owner of the smart wallet
 *    - DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY: Private key of the account that deployed the contracts (used as recipient for test transactions)
 *    - PROXY_TEMPLATE_ADDRESS_ODYSSEY: Address of the deployed proxy template on Odyssey
 *
 * Running instructions:
 *
 * Local testing:
 * ```bash
 * forge script script/Initialize.s.sol --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 --broadcast --ffi
 * ```
 *
 * Odyssey testnet:
 * ```bash
 * forge script script/Initialize.s.sol --rpc-url https://odyssey.ithaca.xyz --broadcast --ffi
 * ```
